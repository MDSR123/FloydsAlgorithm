# FloydsAlgorithm

A java program that implements Floyd's Algorithm. Will output a table showcasing the result.

"The Floyd-Warshall algorithm, also variously known as Floyd's algorithm, the Roy-Floyd algorithm, the Roy-Warshall algorithm, or the WFI algorithm, is an algorithm for efficiently and simultaneously finding the shortest paths (i.e., graph geodesics) between every pair of vertices in a weighted and potentially directed graph." -Wolfram Mathworld
